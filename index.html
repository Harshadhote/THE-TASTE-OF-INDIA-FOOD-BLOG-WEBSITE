        <h2 class="tips">Cooking Tips</h2>
            <h3>Master the Basics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Knife Skills:</strong> Learn to properly hold and use a knife. Practicing basic cuts like dicing, slicing, and chopping will speed up your prep time.</li>
                <li><strong>Mise en Place:</strong> This French term means "everything in its place." Prepare and organize your ingredients before you start cooking to streamline the process.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cooking Techniques</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Browning Meat:</strong> Ensure your pan is hot before adding meat to achieve a good sear, which locks in juices and adds flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Deglazing:</strong> After browning meat, deglaze the pan with wine, broth, or water to incorporate the flavorful bits stuck to the bottom into your sauce.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Baking Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Room Temperature Ingredients:</strong> For baking, use room temperature ingredients like eggs, butter, and milk. This helps them blend more easily and evenly.</li>
                <li><strong>Measure Accurately:</strong> Baking is a science. Use proper measuring cups and spoons, and follow the recipe measurements exactly.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Healthy Cooking</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Steam Vegetables:</strong> Steaming preserves the nutrients in vegetables better than boiling. It also helps maintain their texture and flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Use Less Oil:</strong> Opt for non-stick pans or use cooking spray to reduce the amount of oil needed in your recipes.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Safety Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Proper Food Storage:</strong> Store leftovers in airtight containers and refrigerate them promptly. Label containers with the date to keep track of freshness.</li>
                <li><strong>Knife Safety:</strong> Keep your knives sharp. Dull knives require more force to cut, increasing the risk of slipping and cutting yourself.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Time-Saving Hacks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pre-Chopped Ingredients:</strong> Use pre-chopped vegetables or frozen fruits and veggies to save prep time without sacrificing nutrition.</li>
                <li><strong>Slow Cooker:</strong> Use a slow cooker to prepare meals overnight or while you're at work. This is great for soups, stews, and braised dishes.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Experiment and Enjoy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Try New Recipes:</strong> Dont be afraid to experiment with new recipes and ingredients. Its a great way to expand your culinary skills and discover new favorite dishes.</li>
                <li><strong>Have Fun:</strong> Cooking should be enjoyable, not stressful. Play some music, take your time, and enjoy the process of creating delicious meals.</li>
            </ul>
