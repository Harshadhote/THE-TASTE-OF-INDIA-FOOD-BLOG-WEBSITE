            <h3>Rasgulla Recipe</h3>
            <p>Enjoy the sweet and spongy Bengali delicacy, Rasgulla, with this simple recipe.</p>
            <h4><span>Ingredients: </span></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 liter full cream milk</li>
                <li>2-3 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
                <li>1 cup sugar</li>
                <li>4 cups water</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon rose water (optional)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4><span>Instructions: </span></h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prepare Chhena</strong>: Bring milk to a boil in a large pan. Add lemon juice gradually and stir continuously until the milk curdles. Turn off the heat and let it sit for a few minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Strain Chhena</strong>: Strain the curdled milk using a muslin cloth or a fine strainer to separate the chhena (paneer) from the whey. Rinse the chhena under cold water to remove the lemon flavor. Squeeze out the excess water.</li>
                <li><strong>Knead Chhena</strong>: Knead the chhena for 7-10 minutes to make a smooth, soft dough. Divide the dough into small equal-sized balls, ensuring there are no cracks.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare Sugar Syrup</strong>: In a large pan, mix sugar and water and bring it to a boil. Stir until the sugar dissolves completely. Add rose water if using.</li>
                <li><strong>Cook Rasgullas</strong>: Gently add the chhena balls to the boiling sugar syrup. Cover and cook on medium heat for about 15-20 minutes. The rasgullas will double in size and become spongy. Ensure there is enough space in the pan for the rasgullas to expand.</li>
                <li><strong>Cool and Serve</strong>: Allow the rasgullas to cool in the syrup. Refrigerate for a few hours before serving. Enjoy chilled rasgullas as a delightful dessert.</li>
